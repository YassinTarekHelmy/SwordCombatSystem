## Gained Knowledge

in this project gained knowledge in making combat systems as i usually didn't try to implement an effective freeform combat.

### Key Learnings
- **Input Queueing:** Input Queuing is implemented based on the Command Design Pattern i had knowledge with the command design pattern but it was the first time i implement it in a game mechanic. 
- **Enemy Detection:** To integrate an enemy detection system that is based on the player movement input and to integrate it in the Finite State Machine was a promising experience.
- **AI:** This was the first time to implement a Group Enemy AI that has different states which are cirulating the player, attaching and repositioning.
